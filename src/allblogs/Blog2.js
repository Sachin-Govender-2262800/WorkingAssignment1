<p> Creating a website is an incredibly exciting thing however the success of a website can entirely depend on its web design. 
  As in many cases the website is the face of your brand or business and is how potential customers and viewers are introduced to it.
   A simple website that is well structured and provides great usability is more likely to garner higher views than that of a website with poor user experience. 
   Just like with Movies and Video games there needs to be a visual aspect that lures the audience into wanting to view your website, I would like to discuss what we had to keep 
   in mind when creating our website.
   To further understand how one can improve their website lets first understand what is meant by aesthetics.</p>

<p>Aesthetics is not only in our sense of sight rather it covers our visual, sound and interactive effects, and is a 4D experience (Nikolov, 2017).
   The thought may occur that since we are dealing within a digital platform, that a 4D experience may be obsolete and is something meant more for 
   physical products. This is not the case with recent advancements in technology such as with VR and AR as well as the popularisation of the Metaverse
    designers need to keep an eye out as to how to further improve the users experience in that of a 4D experience. Why do aesthetics matter, aesthetics
     play an important role in marketing and sales as well as customer attraction and conversion. It allows for the target audience to be drawn into the
      website and allows for the specific delivery of information to customers is looking for (Amelzaeem, 2020). Before we discuss about what principles 
      are seen in a successful website let's see the traits of an unsuccessful website.</p>

<p>According to RAMOTION Blog 7 signs of a bad website are:
1.	Being unresponsive 
2.	Not following trends
3.	Neglecting security 
4.	Ditching accessibility 
5.	Confusing mobile friendliness 
6.	Not optimized for SEO 
7.	Ignoring usability 
</p>

<p>In terms of good web design there are 8 essential principles that can be applied according to Pawar, these are: 

1.	 Simplicity is best, as putting too many elements on a page is seen as something that is distracting for visitors and hinders the main purpose of your website,
 it can also assist technically as by not having to load up design features that are unimportant to the website makes the website less frustrating.

2.	Consistency, the website should be planned ahead of time and there should be matching designs throughout the pages of the website.

3.	Typography and Readability, typography should be visually appealing and readable for visitors as the main goal of the website needs to be achieved that being to provide
 the users with the desired information. 

4.	Mobile Compatibility, with the ever growing usage of tablets and smart phones a website must be able to support all screen sizes.

5.	Colour Palette and Imagery, the web designer should ensure that they make us of the perfect colour combinations to attract visitors as using the wrong colour schemes can
 deter visitors and can distract them. Using the right colour palettes can affect the atmosphere of the website and can enhance the user’s experience.

6.	Easy Loading, no one wants to wait too long for a website to load, meaning the website needs to optimize the website by combining code in a focused CSS or JavaScript file, 
optimizing image sizes and compressing Html, JavaScript and CSS.

7.	Easy Navigation, visitors will often stay on websites that have an easier navigation, to create an easier navigation creating a logical page hierarchy is needed before hand.
 One rule that can be followed is the “three-click-rule” so that the information desired can be reached within 3 clicks. 

8.	Communication, in the end the website is designed to spread an ultimate message and that requires that the website communicates effectively with its visitors. 
This can be achieved by organizing information through the use of heading and subheadings, bullet points and removing unnecessary information. 
</p>

<p>In the end we want visitors to remain on our site for as long as possible, this can be achieved by following the principles set as above as well as 
  ensuring that what is seen in poorly designed websites is something your website does not follow. One can also create surveys as well as questionnaires
   about their website from their target market that can assist in designing their website,
   as well as being aware of what competitors are doing.</p>
