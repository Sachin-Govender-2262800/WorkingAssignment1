      <h1>Blog 3: The issues with societies Internet
    </h1>

   <p> The internet is a vast global network, one that has evolved since its initial introduction and one that will continually evolve in the future.
      However with this growth has come issues around the internet reflective not only with a technical aspect but that within Society and Design justice 
      for the web. The entire premise of our website is something that is a digital experience as we focus on Video Games and Movies, these two being digital media platforms
      ,that is why I belive that we should discuss these forms of inequalities. This blog aims to shed some light on just a few of the issues that can be seen within the present digital age, however to start off one 
      needs to understand what digital equality is.</p>

<p>Digital equality in its simplest form is about equality within the digital age, only half of the worldâ€™s population is online and the effort that is used to get
   those people access to the internet has slowed down (Sambul, 2019). This inequality can be further broken down into gendered inequalities seen within political,
    economic domains and sociocultural and there is inequalities between geographies in terms of developing and developed countries this can be seen as an overall issue
     with Digital inclusion vs Exclusion. Having access to the digital space can no longer be seen as a luxury rather it is a civil right that is digital inclusion having 
     the ability for individuals or groups to have access as well as use to information and communication. Data taken from the Institute for Internet and Just Society it
      can be seen that only 39% of people within Africa have access to the internet compared to that of Americans who have a 94.6%, Europeans who have a 87.2% and Latin 
      Americans who have a 70.5% access to the internet. The face that you are able to even view my website as well as to watch many of the movies and play many video games is
      an amazing privilege that not everyone has access to. To achieve the greatest possible benefit out of the internet, there needs to be measures that go towards ensuring
       access to the internet is provided to the greatest number of people. One company trying to solve this is Facebook who have been developing a solution by beaming 
       internet to remote location with automatic piloted balloons however this will take some time before it is complete (Alton, 2017).</p>

<p> This inequality becomes especially prevalent within recent times with the closures of schools due to the Covid-19 pandemic which has brought upon more of a reliance on 
  eLearning within schools, however not every child has access to digital devices that can assist in this learning. This issue is not something that is only affecting students
   but also affecting those less privileged workers as teleworking becomes a much more available option for the minority at the top of the income spectrum 
   (Tataki & Glynos, 2020). Just like Facebook before many non-government and government as well as academic organisations have taken action towards providing 
   broadband and technology education to remote areas (Daniolou, 2020). With an increase in this, it allows for fast and efficient communication with everyone from
    around the globe and allows for new experiences and ideas to be shared, it allows for relationships to form and grow, allows for people to learn from each other
     and it can also be used in cases of emergency. Having access to the internet has shown to have a positive effect on the economy, education, health, business as
      well as the overall wellbeing of rural areas.</p>

<p>The internet is an ever changing space that will only continue to evolve throughout the years however with that growth comes the need for inequality within the digital
   space to be bridged and the digital divide has to be decreased. This has the biggest positive results and can further lead to the evolution of the internet.</p>
