       <p> With this Website being dedicated towards Movies and Video Games I decided to discuss one video game that can sometimes have its own movie plot filled with twitst and turns.
         In this critical analysis, I have taken artwork from the Electronic Literature Collection, from their second volume of works. The artwork is a game known as Façade,
         I chose Façade as it is something that immediately brought back memories to a distant past of not only watching gameplay on YouTube but of myself trying many
          approaches of going through this narrative experience, with it being something I was aware of with prior history it excited me to talk about it.</p>

<p>Façade was developed by two people Michael Mateas and Andrew Stern and was released first in 2005 on Windows for free and later in 2006 on Mac (Thompson, 2020). As described
 by the author “Façade is an artificial intelligence-based art/research experiment in the electronic narrative” (Stern & Mateas, 2005). The game focus on two AI characters
  Grace and Trip and is an interactive experience. Players are placed as a long-time friends of the couple and are invited to an evening of catching up, only for the night
   to turn into an impactful night of drama where player’s choices can lead to multiple endings and can greatly influence the narrative of the game offering an extensive
    opportunity for re-playability. Façade was at its most popular in 2005 and 2006 and as stated above had created many different videos on YouTube which showed gameplay.
     This brings into question the uniqueness of one’s experience when introduced to the game.</p>

<p>This idea is brought upon by Walter Benjamin and his essay “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,” in it he discusses how the reproduction of visual art 
destroys the aura and unique original of the artwork as well as how the creation of film effects how visual artworks are created (Carrier, 2020). On the surface, Façade is
 seen as any other video game experience but Façade unlike most games can be unique no matter who plays it and no matter how many YouTube videos are out there. No two 
 experiences seen and lived through will ever be the same. YouTube did not assist Façade in being an un-unique art form rather it spread awareness of the artwork which
  lead to more people who might not have been exposed to it finding and appreciating the artwork as well as potentially going out to experience it for themselves. 
  In terms of how the film has affected visual artworks Façade seeks to create an experience that can be attributed towards being on stage in a play with two actors
   who aim to create a scene and portray a narrative, one that can be constantly changed depending on the player’s choices. This experience is greatly enhanced with
    the granted now poor graphics, being a 3D game that allows for the character's facial expressions to shine through being closer to a 3D film animation than that of a game.
     The game is short and provides the player with an experience of around 20 to 30 mins, acting as a short film that players have full control over.</p>

<p>Façade creates an interesting approach into the evolution of how narratives can be experienced, no matter how many people interact with artwork it stays a unique experience.
 This can also drastically change not only how games are designed, but movies and theatre plays where more agency is given to the audience in creating the narrative and rewards
  them for being proactive with the artwork allowing the audience to be involved in the project.</p>
