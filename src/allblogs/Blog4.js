      <h1>Blog 4: Self Critique 
    </h1>
    <h2>By Sachin Govender 2262800</h2>

    <div className='blogpara'>
   <p> Today’s blog is going to be a different one rather than one discussing internet art, movies or video games, rather I will be performing a self-critique of
      my website. This is an important thing to do to ensure that my website is not only up to standards for my audience as well as potential viewers but is up to
       my own standards. One of the hardest parts of a critique is analysing the website from a point that isn’t coming from you as in the person who created the 
       website, thus I will be using other websites to critique my own.</p>

<p>From a theoretical point of view I had started my blogs first before I had finalised my theme of my website so there is a definite disconnect between the 
  theme and the theoretical blogs, this will need to be better refined in future blogs as well as updating the current blogs. I do think that my engagement
   with the theory work could have been better however I do also believe that my work engages with not only the readings that are provided from the lecturers
    but also external websites with research being something that is done. This can always be improved however as I believe that I have not worked as diligently 
    as I could have starting the blogs pretty late. I also believe that there needs to be more than the minimum blogs created and that I need to start analysing
     other works and creating blogs around that.</p>

<p> In terms of practical work there is allot to be desired, I believe I started work on the website too late and that the practical work compared to the previous website
   I have created is still lacking. There is however a good base structure of a website however compared to what I had shown in the wireframes there is allot still to
    be done. I have had some issues with what should be simple points in my website. The theme needs to be better defined and the website needs more uniqueness throughout
     the website, there also needs to be more content based of the theme of Video games and Movies however that will be further expanded once the second navigation bar 
     is created unless that idea is removed in the future. The practical components however I believe only scratch the bare minimum of a website and there needs to be 
     more improvements. The website is responsive, and can be easily navigated every point is clear and the user is aware of what they are looking at and are made aware
      of what they would want.</p>

<p>My website can be seen as very simple at the moment and I do have ideas for what I want to do. If the question is am I happy with my website overall the answer would 
  be No I am however happy with the start of my website and there is definitely allot that needs to be done.</p>
