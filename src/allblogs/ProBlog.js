       <p> My project has taken a change from the initial idea. The idea being changed from movies and video games to that of Endangered Animals. After much discussion with myself I had decided to move
          in this direction after being inspired by the works of JJSmooth44 who created a series for WWF Japan – Population by pixel, 
          where he would represent endangered animals as a coloured square representing their population in an image, meaning some images
           are blurrier than others or some can’t even be recognized without the name being shown.  Using this as a basis I have decided to
            make my website represent just how bad this is by making use of a blur effect. Representing most if not all pages by an animal 
            presented by JJSmooth44 depending on just how bad the situation is will determine just how visible the screen and its contents are.
             This is especially prominent in the blogs that are written by me. Users are able to get around this by moving their mouse off the 
             screen or to the side of their screen. Another aspect that is presented in the website for this blur or pixelated effect comes in 
             the form of an Art Pixel Maker. Users are presented with a collage of animals from JJSmooth44 and are presented with the choice to 
             click on an image to move to a Pixel Art Maker, Users are then encouraged to try to create any image based off the blur that is caused 
             due to the animals and their population, an export feature is placed at the bottom allowing users to see what they have created without 
             the blur.</p>

<p>
I had chosen to do this form of artwork as a way to show the users just how bad the situation is with these animals in a more interactive way that actively 
hindered the user’s progression or prevents them from achieving what they should get. In this way I’d like to move more to collaborative participation as there
 is an idea to allow users to submit their pixel arts onto the website that might be viewed by not only themselves but others as well.  I would like to transform
  my website as a whole to be seen as the Net art rather than a specific feature seen in the website.
</p>

<p>This idea is brought upon by Walter Benjamin and his essay “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,” in it he discusses how the reproduction of visual art 
destroys the aura and unique original of the artwork as well as how the creation of film effects how visual artworks are created (Carrier, 2020). On the surface, Façade is
 seen as any other video game experience but Façade unlike most games can be unique no matter who plays it and no matter how many YouTube videos are out there. No two 
 experiences seen and lived through will ever be the same. YouTube did not assist Façade in being an un-unique art form rather it spread awareness of the artwork which
  lead to more people who might not have been exposed to it finding and appreciating the artwork as well as potentially going out to experience it for themselves. 
  In terms of how the film has affected visual artworks Façade seeks to create an experience that can be attributed towards being on stage in a play with two actors
   who aim to create a scene and portray a narrative, one that can be constantly changed depending on the player’s choices. This experience is greatly enhanced with
    the granted now poor graphics, being a 3D game that allows for the character's facial expressions to shine through being closer to a 3D film animation than that of a game.
     The game is short and provides the player with an experience of around 20 to 30 mins, acting as a short film that players have full control over.</p>

<p>
Some challenges as well as features comes in with the addition of displaying all the animals in JJSmooth44’s series within the collage
 as well as having the specific Art Pixel Maker be effected by the specific animals, I would also like to find a way to create a more stylized
  blur having it be pixelated rather than just blurred. I would also like pixilation to be a prominent effect and feature within my website but
   this requires more research, there also needs to be better stylization as well as additions of animals within the website. I would like to add 
   is the addition of API’s that provide further information to inform users of the Animals, these may appear as little pop ups that can be viewed
    whilst working through the Pixel Maker or while reading blogs and would be around the animal the challenge or page is inspired from. A challenge
     then becomes in finding a way to have these pop ups show whilst not being overwhelming or this could be replaced with pop up images of these animals,
      however this needs to be discussed with lectures first if it can be considered as art. I would ideally like to create an image using the collage such 
      as a small animal made up of the images of JJSmooth44’s work while still allowing it to be clickable. These all seem small but I also feel that creating 
      all these features may either be impossible or too much work however this will only be seen through the creation and finalization of the prototype. Each page that has 
      an inspiration from an animal needs to be stylized as such such as having more images of tigers within the page inspired of tigers.
