Simplicity is best, as putting too many elements on a page is seen as something that is distracting for visitors and hinders the main purpose of your website, it can also assist technically as by not having to load up design features that are unimportant to the website makes the website less frustrating. 2. Consistency, the website should be planned ahead of time and there should be matching designs throughout the pages of the website. 3. Typography and Readability, typography should be visually appealing and readable for visitors as the main goal of the website needs to be achieved that being to provide the users with the desired information. 4. Mobile Compatibility, with the ever growing usage of tablets and smart phones a website must be able to support all screen sizes. 5. Colour Palette and Imagery, the web designer should ensure that they make us of the perfect colour combinations to attract visitors as using the wrong colour schemes can deter visitors and can distract them. Using the right colour palettes can affect the atmosphere of the website and can enhance the user\\u2019s experience. 6. Easy Loading, no one wants to wait too long for a website to load, meaning the website needs to optimize the website by combining code in a focused CSS or JavaScript file, optimizing image sizes and compressing Html, JavaScript and CSS. 7. Easy Navigation, visitors will often stay on websites that have an easier navigation, to create an easier navigation creating a logical page hierarchy is needed before hand. One rule that can be followed is the \\u201Cthree-click-rule\\u201D so that the information desired can be reached within 3 clicks. 8.
