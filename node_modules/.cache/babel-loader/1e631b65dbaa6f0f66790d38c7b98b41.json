As of right now this website is designed by one person, me a digital arts student known as Sachin Govender. I decided to create this website due to my intrest with animals and I wanted to express my intrest in this topic basing my website of the art series from JJSmooth44 known as WWF Japan \\u2013 Population by pixel. In this series of artworks he displays images of many diffrent endangered animals, however, he bases the images of how many animals are still around as colored squares. This means that the visibility of the image is entirely reliant on how many animals of a specfic species are around. These images can display just how close some species are to extinction. Based on the specfic animal that the page is inspired by will determin the visiblilty of the text. This website is also filled and will be further filled with blogs, these blogs aim to provide more information about animals or important information that I belive I should spread.
