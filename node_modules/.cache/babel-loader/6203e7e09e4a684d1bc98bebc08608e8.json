The idea being changed from movies and video games to that of Endangered Animals. After much discussion with myself I had decided to move in this direction after being inspired by the works of JJSmooth44 who created a series for WWF Japan \\u2013 Population by pixel, where he would represent endangered animals as a coloured square representing their population in an image, meaning some images are blurrier than others or some can\\u2019t even be recognized without the name being shown.  Using this as a basis I have decided to make my website represent just how bad this is by making use of a blur effect. Representing most if not all pages by an animal presented by JJSmooth44 depending on just how bad the situation is will determine just how visible the screen and its contents are. This is especially prominent in the blogs that are written by me. Users are able to get around this by moving their mouse off the screen or to the side of their screen. Another aspect that is presented in the website for this blur or pixelated effect comes in the form of an Art Pixel Maker. Users are presented with a collage of animals from JJSmooth44 and are presented with the choice to click on an image to move to a Pixel Art Maker, Users are then encouraged to try to create any image based off the blur that is caused due to the animals and their population, an export feature is placed at the bottom allowing users to see what they have created without the blur.\"\n          }, void 0, false, {\n            fileName: _jsxFileName,\n            lineNumber: 36,\n            columnNumber: 8\n          }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"p\", {\n            children: \"I had chosen to do this form of artwork as a way to show the users just how bad the situation is with these animals in a more interactive way that actively hindered the user\\u2019s progression or prevents them from achieving what they should get.

YouTube did not assist Fa\\xE7ade in being an un-unique art form rather it spread awareness of the artwork which lead to more people who might not have been exposed to it finding and appreciating the artwork as well as potentially going out to experience it for themselves. In terms of how the film has affected visual artworks Fa\\xE7ade seeks to create an experience that can be attributed towards being on stage in a play with two actors who aim to create a scene and portray a narrative, one that can be constantly changed depending on the player\\u2019s choices. This experience is greatly enhanced with the granted now poor graphics, being a 3D game that allows for the character's facial expressions to shine through being closer to a 3D film animation than that of a game.
