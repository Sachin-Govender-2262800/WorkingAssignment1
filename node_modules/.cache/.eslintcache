className='blogpara'>\r\n       <p> With this Website being dedicated towards Movies and Video Games I decided to discuss one video game that can sometimes have its own movie plot filled with twitst and turns.\r\n         In this critical analysis, I have taken artwork from the Electronic Literature Collection, from their second volume of works. The artwork is a game known as Façade,\r\n         I chose Façade as it is something that immediately brought back memories to a distant past of not only watching gameplay on YouTube but of myself trying many\r\n          approaches of going through this narrative experience, with it being something I was aware of with prior history it excited me to talk about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Façade was developed by two people Michael Mateas and Andrew Stern and was released first in 2005 on Windows for free and later in 2006 on Mac (Thompson, 2020). As described\r\n by the author “Façade is an artificial intelligence-based art/research experiment in the electronic narrative” (Stern & Mateas, 2005). The game focus on two AI characters\r\n  Grace and Trip and is an interactive experience. Players are placed as a long-time friends of the couple and are invited to an evening of catching up, only for the night\r\n   to turn into an impactful night of drama where player’s choices can lead to multiple endings and can greatly influence the narrative of the game offering an extensive\r\n    opportunity for re-playability. Façade was at its most popular in 2005 and 2006 and as stated above had created many different videos on YouTube which showed gameplay.\r\n     This brings into question the uniqueness of one’s experience when introduced to the game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This idea is brought upon by Walter Benjamin and his essay “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,” in it he discusses how the reproduction of visual art \r\ndestroys the aura and unique original of the artwork as well as how the creation of film effects how visual artworks are created (Carrier, 2020). On the surface, Façade is\r\n seen as any other video game experience but Façade unlike most games can be unique no matter who plays it and no matter how many YouTube videos are out there. No two \r\n experiences seen and lived through will ever be the same. YouTube did not assist Façade in being an un-unique art form rather it spread awareness of the artwork which\r\n  lead to more people who might not have been exposed to it finding and appreciating the artwork as well as potentially going out to experience it for themselves. \r\n  In terms of how the film has affected visual artworks Façade seeks to create an experience that can be attributed towards being on stage in a play with two actors\r\n   who aim to create a scene and portray a narrative, one that can be constantly changed depending on the player’s choices. This experience is greatly enhanced with\r\n    the granted now poor graphics, being a 3D game that allows for the character's facial expressions to shine through being closer to a 3D film animation than that of a game.\r\n     The game is short and provides the player with an experience of around 20 to 30 mins, acting as a short film that players have full control over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Façade creates an interesting approach into the evolution of how narratives can be experienced, no matter how many people interact with artwork it stays a unique experience.\r\n This can also drastically change not only how games are designed, but movies and theatre plays where more agency is given to the audience in creating the narrative and rewards\r\n  them for being proactive with the artwork allowing the audience to be involved in the project.</p> \r\n\r\n\r\n<div className='blogrefrences'>\r\n  <h3>Refrences</h3>\r\n  <p1>Carrier, D.

This is an important thing to do to ensure that my website is not only up to standards for my audience as well as potential viewers but is up to\r\n       my own standards. One of the hardest parts of a critique is analysing the website from a point that isn’t coming from you as in the person who created the \r\n       website, thus I will be using other websites to critique my own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From a theoretical point of view I had started my blogs first before I had finalised my theme of my website so there is a definite disconnect between the \r\n  theme and the theoretical blogs, this will need to be better refined in future blogs as well as updating the current blogs. I do think that my engagement\r\n   with the theory work could have been better however I do also believe that my work engages with not only the readings that are provided from the lecturers\r\n    but also external websites with research being something that is done. This can always be improved however as I believe that I have not worked as diligently \r\n    as I could have starting the blogs pretty late. I also believe that there needs to be more than the minimum blogs created and that I need to start analysing\r\n     other works and creating blogs around that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> In terms of practical work there is allot to be desired, I believe I started work on the website too late and that the practical work compared to the previous website\r\n   I have created is still lacking. There is however a good base structure of a website however compared to what I had shown in the wireframes there is allot still to\r\n    be done. I have had some issues with what should be simple points in my website. The theme needs to be better defined and the website needs more uniqueness throughout\r\n     the website, there also needs to be more content based of the theme of Video games and Movies however that will be further expanded once the second navigation bar \r\n     is created unless that idea is removed in the future. The practical components however I believe only scratch the bare minimum of a website and there needs to be \r\n     more improvements. The website is responsive, and can be easily navigated every point is clear and the user is aware of what they are looking at and are made aware\r\n      of what they would want.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My website can be seen as very simple at the moment and I do have ideas for what I want to do. If the question is am I happy with my website overall the answer would \r\n  be No I am however happy with the start of my website and there is definitely allot that needs to be done.</p> \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    )\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n","C:\\Users\\sachi\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\InteractiveMedia\\Year4\\IMStuff\\myapp\\myfirstapp\\src\\allblogs\\Blog3.js",["221","222"],[],"import React, { Component } from 'react'\r\nimport \"../styles/Home.css\";\r\nimport HomepageBanner from '../assets/1600w-1NYTq34QR6I.png';\r\nimport {Link} from 'react-router-dom';\r\n\r\nexport default class blog3 extends Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div className = \"fullBlog\">\r\n\r\n      <h1>Blog 3: The issues with societies Internet\r\n    </h1>\r\n    <h2>By Sachin Govender 2262800</h2>\r\n    <br></br>\r\n    <div className='blogpara'>\r\n   <p> The internet is a vast global network, one that has evolved since its initial introduction and one that will continually evolve in the future.\r\n      However with this growth has come issues around the internet reflective not only with a technical aspect but that within Society and Design justice \r\n      for the web. The entire premise of our website is something that is a digital experience as we focus on Video Games and Movies, these two being digital media platforms\r\n      ,that is why I belive that we should discuss these forms of inequalities. This blog aims to shed some light on just a few of the issues that can be seen within the present digital age, however to start off one \r\n      needs to understand what digital equality is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Digital equality in its simplest form is about equality within the digital age, only half of the world’s population is online and the effort that is used to get\r\n   those people access to the internet has slowed down (Sambul, 2019). This inequality can be further broken down into gendered inequalities seen within political,\r\n    economic domains and sociocultural and there is inequalities between geographies in terms of developing and developed countries this can be seen as an overall issue\r\n     with Digital inclusion vs Exclusion. Having access to the digital space can no longer be seen as a luxury rather it is a civil right that is digital inclusion having \r\n     the ability for individuals or groups to have access as well as use to information and communication. Data taken from the Institute for Internet and Just Society it\r\n      can be seen that only 39% of people within Africa have access to the internet compared to that of Americans who have a 94.6%, Europeans who have a 87.2% and Latin \r\n      Americans who have a 70.5% access to the internet. The face that you are able to even view my website as well as to watch many of the movies and play many video games is\r\n      an amazing privilege that not everyone has access to. To achieve the greatest possible benefit out of the internet, there needs to be measures that go towards ensuring\r\n       access to the internet is provided to the greatest number of people. One company trying to solve this is Facebook who have been developing a solution by beaming \r\n       internet to remote location with automatic piloted balloons however this will take some time before it is complete (Alton, 2017).</p>\r\n\r\n<p> This inequality becomes especially prevalent within recent times with the closures of schools due to the Covid-19 pandemic which has brought upon more of a reliance on \r\n  eLearning within schools, however not every child has access to digital devices that can assist in this learning. This issue is not something that is only affecting students\r\n   but also affecting those less privileged workers as teleworking becomes a much more available option for the minority at the top of the income spectrum \r\n   (Tataki & Glynos, 2020). Just like Facebook before many non-government and government as well as academic organisations have taken action towards providing \r\n   broadband and technology education to remote areas (Daniolou, 2020). With an increase in this, it allows for fast and efficient communication with everyone from\r\n    around the globe and allows for new experiences and ideas to be shared, it allows for relationships to form and grow, allows for people to learn from each other\r\n     and it can also be used in cases of emergency. Having access to the internet has shown to have a positive effect on the economy, education, health, business as\r\n      well as the overall wellbeing of rural areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The internet is an ever changing space that will only continue to evolve throughout the years however with that growth comes the need for inequality within the digital\r\n   space to be bridged and the digital divide has to be decreased. This has the biggest positive results and can further lead to the evolution of the internet.</p> \r\n\r\n\r\n<div className='blogrefrences'>\r\n<h3>Refrences</h3>\r\n<p1>\r\nAlton, L. A.

This is not the case with recent advancements in technology such as with VR and AR as well as the popularisation of the Metaverse\r\n    designers need to keep an eye out as to how to further improve the users experience in that of a 4D experience. Why do aesthetics matter, aesthetics\r\n     play an important role in marketing and sales as well as customer attraction and conversion. It allows for the target audience to be drawn into the\r\n      website and allows for the specific delivery of information to customers is looking for (Amelzaeem, 2020). Before we discuss about what principles \r\n      are seen in a successful website let's see the traits of an unsuccessful website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to RAMOTION Blog 7 signs of a bad website are:\r\n1.\tBeing unresponsive \r\n2.\tNot following trends\r\n3.\tNeglecting security \r\n4.\tDitching accessibility \r\n5.\tConfusing mobile friendliness \r\n6.\tNot optimized for SEO \r\n7.\tIgnoring usability \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of good web design there are 8 essential principles that can be applied according to Pawar, these are: \r\n\r\n1.\t Simplicity is best, as putting too many elements on a page is seen as something that is distracting for visitors and hinders the main purpose of your website,\r\n it can also assist technically as by not having to load up design features that are unimportant to the website makes the website less frustrating.\r\n\r\n2.\tConsistency, the website should be planned ahead of time and there should be matching designs throughout the pages of the website.\r\n\r\n3.\tTypography and Readability, typography should be visually appealing and readable for visitors as the main goal of the website needs to be achieved that being to provide\r\n the users with the desired information. \r\n\r\n4.\tMobile Compatibility, with the ever growing usage of tablets and smart phones a website must be able to support all screen sizes.\r\n\r\n5.\tColour Palette and Imagery, the web designer should ensure that they make us of the perfect colour combinations to attract visitors as using the wrong colour schemes can\r\n deter visitors and can distract them. Using the right colour palettes can affect the atmosphere of the website and can enhance the user’s experience.\r\n\r\n6.\tEasy Loading, no one wants to wait too long for a website to load, meaning the website needs to optimize the website by combining code in a focused CSS or JavaScript file, \r\noptimizing image sizes and compressing Html, JavaScript and CSS.\r\n\r\n7.\tEasy Navigation, visitors will often stay on websites that have an easier navigation, to create an easier navigation creating a logical page hierarchy is needed before hand.\r\n One rule that can be followed is the “three-click-rule” so that the information desired can be reached within 3 clicks. \r\n\r\n8.\tCommunication, in the end the website is designed to spread an ultimate message and that requires that the website communicates effectively with its visitors. \r\nThis can be achieved by organizing information through the use of heading and subheadings, bullet points and removing unnecessary information. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end we want visitors to remain on our site for as long as possible, this can be achieved by following the principles set as above as well as \r\n  ensuring that what is seen in poorly designed websites is something your website does not follow. One can also create surveys as well as questionnaires\r\n   about their website from their target market that can assist in designing their website,\r\n   as well as being aware of what competitors are doing.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div className='blogrefrences'>\r\n  <h3>Refrences</h3>\r\n  <p1>20 Bad Website Design Examples and How to Avoid Them.

I also need to create a better layout of the blogs as well as having a clear consistent font style for the blogs. The background Image that is used for \r\n              the Homepage as well as other pages will be changed so that every page is in someway unique if possible. The colors may be updated however as of right now I like the color \r\n              scheme. The logo that is placed on the Top right of the website is a placeholder logo just until I am able to design the logo I want for the website. I would also like to have \r\n              an image similar to that of the about page for the blogs, unfortunatley the images i tried to put with the blogs refused to be displayed and that is an issue I need to fix.\r\n              I also need to better create and change the layout of multiple pages that being the About, contact, homepage as well as the Design page and Blogs index page. There also needs\r\n              to be the creation of more navigation links based of the theme of the website which is based around Video games and Movies.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      \r\n
